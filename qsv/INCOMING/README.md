The INCOMING folder contains DRAFT recipes.

Test data for each INCOMING recipe should have accompanying test data in the `test_data` folder. The test data should be organized in the same way as the recipe folder structure. For example, if the recipe is in `qsv/INCOMING/1.0.0/Enrichment/`, the test data should be in `test_data/qsv/INCOMING/1.0.0/Enrichment/`.
