The PROD folder contains PRODUCTION recipes.

Test data for each PRODUCTION recipe should have accompanying test data in the `testdata` folder. The test data should be organized in the same way as the recipe folder structure. For example, if the recipe is in `qsv/PRODUCTION/1.0.0/Enrichment/`, the test data should be in `test_data/qsv/PRODUCTION/1.0.0/Enrichment/`.
